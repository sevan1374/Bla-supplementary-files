Zip files Descriptions:

Files_1.zip contains 4 folders, including:

	 1- Beta_lactamases_subgroups: Contains 5 folders with the alignments for all classes of β-lactamases, along with Active_site_motifs.xlsx, which summarizes the active site motifs for each subgroup.

	 2- HMM_files: Includes HMM files for all classes of β-lactamases and RecA (collected from the GTDB HMM database).

	 3- Non_Beta_lactamase_subgroups: Contains 5 folders with alignments for all classes of non-β-lactamases, along with Summary_non-Beta_lactamase.xlsx, which summarizes the structural motifs, active site motifs, and phylogenetic placements of non-β-lactamase subgroups.

	 4- Sequence_files: Includes sequence files for all classes of β-lactamases, as well as RecA.

Files_2.zip contains:
		6 folders, each corresponding to structural data for a specific class or subclass—including metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs)—of non-β-lactamase proteins.
	Within each folder, subdirectories are named according to subgroup identifiers and include both collected and predicted structures.
	An additional msa folder provides the structural alignments for each subgroup, generated using FoldMason.
	The file naming convention follows the format:
	"subgroup_name" + "_" + "class_" + "beta_lactamase_class"
	Each HTML file includes both the structural and sequence alignments for the corresponding subgroup.

Files_3.zip contains:
		6 folders, each corresponding to structural data for a specific class or subclass—including metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs)—of β-lactamase proteins.
	Similar to Files_2.zip, each folder contains subdirectories named by subgroup identifiers, with both collected and predicted structures.
	An msa folder provides the FoldMason-generated structural alignments.
	File names follow the same format:
	"subgroup_name" + "_" + "class_" + "beta_lactamase_class"
	Each HTML file includes both structural and sequence alignments for the respective subgroup.
